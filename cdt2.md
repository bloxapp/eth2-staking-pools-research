A new version of the CDT contract is required to be created to support new functionlaities. 
CDT 2.0 will remain to be an ERC-20 compatible token.

## Stakable
As block producers(BP) become the backbone of the new pool chain, CDT is becoming the fuel that sets the correct incentive for honest execution and diincentive for malicous behaviour. 
Anyone who wants to become a BP must submit a deposit that acts as a colleteral. To enable this functionality nativley, the new CDT 2.0 contract will have a built in staking functionality, specific for BP responsibilities. 

## Remaining on ethereum
One of the goals for CDT 2.0 is to remian on thee ethereum blockchain and continue to be part of its eco-system. Although it would be easy to add a native component to the pool chain, doing that will lose the benefits of staying on ethereum.
