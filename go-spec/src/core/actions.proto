// A request struct for creating new pool credentials

//
// How it works?
// - A user sends 32 eth and create pool request
// - The first BP that sees it, will post a CreatePoolRequest with Status 0 and will nominate the next BP as the leader for the DKG
//   (the 128 DKG participants are deterministically selected as well)
// - If during the next Epoch the DKG is successful, the BP (which is also the DKG leader) posts a CreatePoolRequest with the same ID,
//   Status 1 and the created pub key
// - If the DKG is un-successful, the BP will post a CreatePoolRequest with the same ID, Status 3 and will nominate the next BP as leader
//
// A successful DKG will reward the leader and DKG participants
// A non-successful DKG will penalized the DKG participants
