# Consensus - Creating New Pools
[![blox.io](https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/app-files.blox.io/static/media/powered_by.png)](https://www.bloxstaking.com)


The process of creating a new validator which can be managed by a pool goes through the same process as any other validator.\
For more details see [eth 2.0 spec](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/blob/dev/specs/phase0/validator.md#becoming-a-validator).\
The difference is in creating a pool controlled validator, where the validator's keys are created via a [DKG scheme](https://github.com/bloxapp/eth2-staking-pools-research/blob/master/dkg.md).
